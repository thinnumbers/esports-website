          <span>E-Sports is becoming one of the most profitable industries to ever exist. What used to be a hobby for many, playing games with family and friends to a full on career for
            those who are good enough at these competitive video games, including League of Legends, Overwatch, Smash Bros, Fornite, etc.
          These E-Sports players are now getting picked up by sponsors and teams to financially support them through their competitive tournaments for their respective games
          For a long time, these players have only been earning whatever they won at a gaming competition however now some organizations have been created to sponsor these player so
          they can go full time with these games. And now we have Blizzard creating Overwatch League similar to how NBA and NFL work. Teams representing each region to play Overwatch like New York Excelsior, Shanghai Dragons and London Spitfire.

             The controversy occurs with the fact that many people do not take E-Sports as seriously as mainstream sports. How can "playing games" be considered work?
            E-Sports organizations are also trying to treat E-Sports as like an actual sport, for example, by providing their players with jerseys that represent the team.
            But why would you need to wear a jersey for gaming? Why jerseys over t-shirts? On the other hand, an argument can be applied to mainstream sports as well.
            Sports can also be considered "playing games". It's because sports are more physical than E-sports, people tend to take sports more seriously and separate from E-Sports.
            With this mindset as well, people like to think that these professional gamers have it easy compared to soccer or basketball players.

            get any screen time on television like sports are. However times are changing and some games are being televised. An example mentioned before
            Overwatch league can be seen on ESPN and Disney XD. Overwatch League players earn a salary under Blizzard. Though many game companies are hopping on the E-Sports craze
            a lot of others don't understand and see their game as just something for fun with the family. Players have to show these game companies their excitment for E-Sports.
